        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> Driven and determined Applied software engineering student who is willing to learn alongside being hardworking and passionate.
          My course is focused on producing full-stack software engineers. Thus far, I have studied the modules mentioned below.
          One of my competencies is the social aspect of development projects; being assessed as a good presenter and benefitting from my course's focus on working in an agile environment by crediting source control, sprint meetings, and representations.
          Solving complicated computing and engineering problems is a fulfilling passion of mine and my next goal is to apply the skills I am learning in the industry. </p>

          <h2> Project </h2>
          <h3> Chartist walking trials (Nov 2019 – Jan 2020) </h3>
          <p>
            The project was given to us by the Newport City Council. It consisted of creating a website application to help the users in finding the easiest walking routes.
            The project was developed in accordance with the client's requirements which was to display the Chartist Trail in Newport with directions, heritage orientated information, feedback page, and an admin console whereby the client could edit the Chartist Trail.
            The website application consisted of two user types, the admin and the trail walker.
            In our team, we used Taiga as our form of agile scrum methodology. This ensured we had regular meetings to discuss previous, current, and future tasks for the project and track progress of teammates.
            Also, we used tools such as: Git, Taiga, Flask, Python, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Ajax, JavaScript, jQuery, Geolocation, External Libraries e.g. Bootstrap, Cookies, and Sessions.

        <h2>VOLUNTEERING </h2>
        <h3> Red Cross youth, Denmark (2014-2018) </h3>
        <p>I was the Head of Linguistics and part of a bigger team devoted towards empowering young refugees. My role, being trilingual, involved teaching them Danish and English languages through taking them out, mentoring them, as well as well as encouraging them to share their experiences. This proved immensely challenging, at first, given how most of them did not either speak English or were not too vocal after their tragic experiences in Syria. However, through my patience and repetitive hard work, I managed to help a group of 50 young refugees surmount the immense language barrier.
        </p>

        <h3>Yes, to love Lithuania (1/09/2019-30/09/2019) </h3>
        <p>The objective of the youth exchange was to address hate speech and hate crime firmly shown in communities across Europe.
        It can have adverse negative effects, so it is vital to address it and fight it.
        I was the team leader for the Danish team, so I had to organize presentations, participate in meetings along with other leaders and basically manage my team performance in the project. </p>
